= kubehosts

Alternative to default-http-backend that tells you how to configure your `/etc/hosts` file.

== When to use it

Typically when you configure kubernetes with ingresses, you set it up such that kubernetes updates a DNS provider with your ingresses.
Sometimes, you do not intend to use a DNS provider because you're running short experiments.
Sometimes, you have a DNS provider that does not have an API, and you need to have a faster way to get the DNS mappings to your users.
Regardless, This pod can make that easier for you.

== How to use it

Typically you need to replace the image in `default-http-backend` image with this one.
